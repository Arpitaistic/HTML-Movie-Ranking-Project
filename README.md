# HTML-Movie-Ranking-Project
In this project, I've implemented fundamental HTML elements such as heading tags, paragraph tags, the horizontal rule (hr) tag, and the line break (br) tag. These elements collectively form the building blocks of web content structuring and formatting. Excited to share my initial steps in web development! 💻🌐 #HTMLBeginner #WebDevJourney
